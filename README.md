## Coding Style

Enforced by Prettier and ESlint
Make sure to use `VScode` and install extensions

#### [`Prettier`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) [`ESlint`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

### End-of-Line Character Sequences: LF

Check at the bottom line of your VScode
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76548593/183066753-b3c8a3b1-89b7-42c4-9007-ae5fa7cc0401.png)
:bangbang: if you are on Windows system, git will tempt to convert LF to CRLF. To cahnge this, configured your git by
`git config core.autocrlf false`

### Using PropTypes
import PropTypes with
`import PropTypes from 'prop-types'`

example:

```
const Component =({prop1='', prop2=()=>{})=>{

}

Component.propTypes = {
    /** description of the prop**/
    prop1=PropTypes.string,
    prop2=PropTypes.func,
}
```
